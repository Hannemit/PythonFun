## HanneSnake, a snake game written in python using curses (currently not working)

The goal of HanneSnake is to eat 40 units of food without letting the snake die. Units of food are represented by greater-than-or-equal signs. The number of food units consumed is shown in the upper left corner. Throughout the game, motivational statements are shown to encourage the player to continue playing!

The snake can die in two ways: 
1) it hits the border of the terminal
2) it hits a less-than-or-equal sign.

The game seems easy enough, but **be aware**, the snake increases its speed throughout the game, and more and more less-than-or-equal signs pop up. The game can be played at three different difficulties: medium, hard and very hard.
