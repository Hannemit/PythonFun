## HanneSnake, a snake game written in python using curses.

The goal of HanneSnake is to eat 40 units of food without letting the snake die. Units of food are represented by greater-than-or-equal signs. The snake can die in two ways: 1) it hits the border of the terminal, 2) it hits a less-than-or-equal sign.
The game seems easy enough, but **be aware**, the snake increases its speed throughout the game, and more and more less-than-or-equal signs pop up. The game can be played at three different difficulties: medium, hard and very hard.
